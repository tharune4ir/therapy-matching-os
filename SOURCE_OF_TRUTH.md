## 📖 1. Project Overview & Clinical Hook

**Therapy Matching OS** is an AI-native concept prototype built by a Zero-to-One AI Product Manager (Tharun Gajula). It explores multi-layer compatibility algorithms for client-therapist matching.

Unlike generic directories that sort by price or availability, Therapy Matching OS optimizes for the **Therapeutic Alliance**—the single strongest predictor of clinical success (accounting for ~8% of therapy outcome variance; *Flückiger et al., 2018*). It operates on a high-fidelity 58-point data model designed to match Indian professionals navigating modern concerns (SaaS burnout, joint-family dynamics, caste reckoning, NRI-returnee diaspora stress) with highly specialized, culturally-literate therapists.

### Custom Design System (Meditation & Authority)
Built on a bespoke design system designed to project clinical authority and meditative calm:
*   **Colors (configured in `tailwind.config.ts`):**
    *   `therapy-primary`: `#7A9E7E` (Sage green for growth)
    *   `therapy-primary-deep`: `#3F5E45` (Forest green for clinical authority)
    *   `therapy-secondary`: `#C9B8E0` (Lavender for soothing)
    *   `therapy-accent`: `#D4A574` (Warm sand for grounding warmth)
    *   `therapy-bg`: `#F7F3ED` (Warm white/parchment background)
    *   `therapy-surface`: `#EDEAE3` (Soft gray-brown container backgrounds)
    *   `therapy-text`: `#2A2E2B` (Deep charcoal, off-black readability)
    *   `therapy-text-muted`: `#6F756F` (Soft muted slate for captions)
    *   `therapy-crisis`: `#C9534F` (Crisis red alert)
*   **Typography:**
    *   `serif`: `Fraunces` (`--font-fraunces` variable) for headings to establish medical authority.
    *   `sans`: `Inter` (`--font-inter` variable) for structured interface elements.
*   **Interactions:** Fluid animations (`animate-breathe` with translateY + fade-in), glassmorphism, responsive light-mode forced scaling, and unified mobile-app frame constraints.

## ⚙️ 2. Core Architecture: The Three-Layer Matching Engine

The engine is implemented in [lib/engine/matching.ts](file:///d:/000_before%20portfolio_10526/1_Product%20Lab%20Portfolio/therapy-matching-os/therapy-matching-os/lib/engine/matching.ts) and executes a strict pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Profile] --> B{Layer 1: Hard Filters}
    B -- Passes Gates --> C[Layer 2: Weighted Compatibility]
    B -- Fails Gates --> Z[Reject Candidate]
    C --> D[SumProduct + Modifiers]
    D --> E[Top 3 Ranked Matches]
    E --> F[Layer 3: Feedback Loops ORS/SRS]
    F --> G[Dynamic Weight Adjustments]
```

### Layer 1: Hard Filters (Binary Gates)
A candidate therapist must pass all active binary filters. Some filters are **rigid (never relaxed)**, while others are **relaxable** in increments when zero candidates are returned:

| ID | Filter Name | Relaxable? | Logic & Rules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1** | Language Match | **Never** | `user.languages` must share at least 1 overlapping element with `therapist.languages`. |
| **H5** | Queer-Affirmation Gate | **Never** | If `user.sexuality` is `['gay', 'lesbian', 'bi', 'queer', 'bisexual']` or `user.gender` is `['NB', 'trans', 'they/them']`, therapist **must** be `qacpCertified: true`. |
| **H7** | Trauma Specialty Gate | **Never** | If `user.primaryConcerns` contains any concern code starting with `"3."` (Trauma) **and** `user.severity >= 7`, therapist **must** have `traumaSpecialization: true` or have `EMDR` in `modalities`. |
| **H8** | Clinical Severity Gate | **Never** | If `user.severity >= 8`, therapist **must** have an RCI license (`rciNumber !== ''`) or be a psychiatrist (`isPsychiatrist: true`). |
| **H9** | Strong Gender Preference | **Never** | If `user.therapistGenderPref` starts with `"Strong "` (e.g., `"Strong F"` or `"Strong M"`), therapist's `gender` must match exactly (e.g. `gender === 'F'` or `gender === 'M'`). |
| **H14** | Format Compatibility | **Relaxed at Level >= 2** | `user.formatPref` must share at least 1 element with `therapist.formats`. |
| **H3** | Fee Fit | **Relaxed at Level >= 3** | `therapist.fee` must be `<= user.budgetMax * 1.10`. |
| **H4** | Availability Overlap | **Relaxed at Level >= 1** | `user.timePref` must overlap with `therapist.availability` or therapist must offer `"Flexible"`, or user time preference must be `"Flexible"` or `"Irregular"`. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The relaxation loop automatically increments `relaxLevel` from `0` to `4` in a `while` loop until at least one candidate passes.

---

### Layer 2: Compatibility Scoring (SumProduct Engine)
For all passing candidates, a similarity score is calculated across individual weighted dimensions.

#### Default Weights (`DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`)
```typescript
export const DEFAULT_WEIGHTS = {
  W1: 18, W2: 9, W3: 9, W4: 6, W5: 5,
  W6: 8, W7: 5, W8: 7, W9: 4, W10: 5,
  W11: 4, W12: 2, W13: 3, W14: 2, W15: 2,
  W16: 3, W17: 2, W18: 2, W19: 1, W20: 2,
  W21: 3, W22: 2, W23: 1, W24: 2, W25: 2,
  W26: 1, W27: 1, W28: 3 // negative modifier
};
```

#### Math & Scoring Formula per Dimension ($W_x$):
Individual dimension scores are evaluated on a `0 - 100` scale:

1.  **W1: Presenting Concern × Specialization**
    *   $\text{Score} = \text{Min}\left(100, \left(\frac{|\text{Overlapping Concerns}|}{|\text{User Primary Concerns}|} \times 100\right) + \text{Bonus}\right)$
    *   $\text{Bonus} = 20$ if the therapist's top 3 specializations include the user's #1 primary concern.
2.  **C-NIP (Complementary-Negative Interpersonal Pattern) Fit (W2 - W5)**
    *   The C-NIP scales represent personality preferences measured from `-15` to `+15` (30-point range):
        *   **W2 (Communication Style - Directiveness):** $100 - \left(\frac{|\text{user.cnip.directiveness} - \text{therapist.cnip.directiveness}|}{30} \times 100\right)$
        *   **W3 (Emotional Warmth - Warmth):** $100 - \left(\frac{|\text{user.cnip.warmth} - \text{therapist.cnip.warmth}|}{30} \times 100\right)$
        *   **W4 (Session Intensity - Emotional Intensity):** $100 - \left(\frac{|\text{user.cnip.emotionalIntensity} - \text{therapist.cnip.emotionalIntensity}|}{30} \times 100\right)$
        *   **W5 (Approach - Past vs. Present Focus):** $100 - \left(\frac{|\text{user.cnip.pastOrientation} - \text{therapist.cnip.pastOrientation}|}{30} \times 100\right)$
3.  **W6: Stage of Change × Therapist Directiveness**
    *   If user in `['Pre-contemplation', 'Contemplation']` and therapist `directiveness <= 5`: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   If user in `['Preparation', 'Action', 'Maintenance']` and therapist `directiveness >= 6`: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   Otherwise (Mismatch): $\text{Score} = 30$
4.  **W7: Attachment Style Fit**
    *   If user is `Secure`: $\text{Score} = 80$
    *   If user is `Anxious-preoccupied`: $\text{Score} = 100$ (if therapist `warmth >= 8`), otherwise `40`
    *   If user is `Dismissive-avoidant`: $\text{Score} = 90$ (if therapist `emotionalIntensity <= 0`), otherwise `50`
    *   If user is `Fearful-avoidant`: $\text{Score} = 100$ (if therapist has `traumaSpecialization` and `warmth >= 8`), otherwise `50`
5.  **W8: Modality Fit to Concern**
    *   $\text{Baseline} = 80$
    *   $\text{Score} = 100$ if:
        *   User has concern `8.1` (OCD) and therapist has modality `CBT`
        *   User has concern `3.1` (PTSD) and therapist has modality `EMDR`
        *   User has concern `5.4` (Existential) and therapist has modality `Psychodynamic` or `Humanistic`
6.  **W9: Language Richness & Mother-Tongue**
    *   $\text{Score} = \text{Min}\left(100, \left(\frac{|\text{Shared Languages}|}{|\text{User Languages}|} \times 100\right) + \text{Bonus}\right)$
    *   $\text{Bonus} = 25$ if therapist speaks the user's primary/first language (`user.languages[0]`).
7.  **W10: Cultural Competency**
    *   If user has no cultural sensitivities: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   Otherwise: $\frac{|\text{User Sensitivities } \cap \text{ Therapist Competencies}|}{|\text{User Sensitivities}|} \times 100$
8.  **W11: Therapist Gender Soft Preference**
    *   If user is `Either`: $\text{Score} = 80$
    *   If user preference matches therapist's gender: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 50$
9.  **W12: Age Band Fit**
    *   $\text{Baseline} = 80$ (Standardized baseline value for prototype)
10. **W13: Fee Fit**
    *   If therapist fee falls in range `[user.budgetMin, user.budgetMax]`: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   If fee exceeds `budgetMax` but is within $15\%$ buffer (`<= user.budgetMax * 1.15`): $\text{Score} = 70$
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 0$
11. **W14: Format Fit**
    *   If therapist matches user's first choice format preference: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   If matching second choice: $\text{Score} = 80$
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 60$
12. **W15: Availability Fit**
    *   If user has no time preferences: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   Otherwise: $\frac{|\text{Overlapping Timeslots}|}{|\text{User Time Preferences}|} \times 100$ (with `"Flexible"` and `"Irregular"` acting as wildcard overlaps).
13. **W16: Therapist Experience vs. Severity**
    *   If user `severity >= 8`: $\text{Score} = 100$ if therapist `yearsExperience >= 10`, `70` if `yearsExperience >= 5`, otherwise `40`.
    *   If user `severity < 8`: $\text{Score} = 100$.
14. **W17: Religious Literacy**
    *   If user has religious sensitivities and therapist has matching competency: $\text{Score} = 100$
    *   If user `religiousSalience <= 3` (Low importance): $\text{Score} = 90$
    *   If user `religiousSalience >= 7` and therapist does **not** support it: $\text{Score} = 40$ (Misalignment)
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 80$
15. **W18: Caste-Aware Practice Flag**
    *   If user lists `Caste` or `Dalit/Bahujan` in cultural sensitivities: $\text{Score} = 100$ if therapist has `Anti-caste` competency, otherwise `60`.
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 100$.
16. **W19: NRI/Diaspora Literacy**
    *   If user lists `NRI diaspora` or `NRI dynamics`: $\text{Score} = 100$ if therapist has `NRI/diaspora` competency, otherwise `50`.
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 100$.
17. **W20: Prior Therapy Fit**
    *   If user is `Experienced`: $\text{Score} = 100$ if therapist modalities include `Psychodynamic`, `IFS`, or `Narrative`, otherwise `80`.
    *   If user is `First-timer`: $\text{Score} = 100$ if therapist has `CBT` or `Solution-focused`, otherwise `80`.
18. **W21: Therapist Warmth**
    *   If user CNIP warmth suggests extreme warmth-seeking (`cnip.warmth <= -7`), therapist must have high warmth (`warmth >= 9`) for $\text{Score} = 100$, otherwise `60`.
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 80$.
19. **W22: Therapist Challenge**
    *   If user CNIP warmth suggests extreme challenge-seeking (`cnip.warmth >= 7`), therapist must have high challenge (`challenge >= 7`) for $\text{Score} = 100$, otherwise `60`.
    *   Otherwise: $\text{Score} = 80$.
20. **W23: Pace Alignment**
    *   $\text{Baseline} = 80$ (Baseline value)
21. **W24: Session-5 Retention Prior**
    *   Normalized score of therapist's historical retention relative to range $[0.65, 0.95]$:
    *   $\text{Score} = \text{Max}\left(0, \text{Min}\left(100, \frac{\text{therapist.session5Retention} - 0.65}{0.95 - 0.65} \times 100\right)\right)$
22. **W25: Average SRS Bond Prior**
    *   Normalized score of therapist's average SRS score relative to range $[3.2, 4.8]$:
    *   $\text{Score} = \text{Max}\left(0, \text{Min}\left(100, \frac{\text{therapist.avgSrsBond} - 3.2}{4.8 - 3.2} \times 100\right)\right)$
23. **W26: Capacity/Waitlist Prior**
    *   $\text{Baseline} = 100$ (Assumed available within 7 days for the prototype)
24. **W27: Specialization Depth**
    *   $\text{Score} = 100$ if therapist's #1 specialization matches user's #1 primary concern, otherwise `80`.

#### W28: Struggles-with Anti-Match Penalty (Negative Modifier)
If the user's primary concerns overlap with any of the therapist's `strugglesWith` concern tags, `dims.W28` is set to `100`.
*   This triggers a **flat subtraction of 25 points** from the final calculated compatibility average:
    $$\text{Final Score} = \text{Score}_{\text{weighted}} - 25$$

#### Weighted Average calculation:
$$\text{Score}_{\text{weighted}} = \frac{\sum_{x=1}^{27} (\text{dims.W}_x \times \text{weights.W}_x)}{\sum_{x=1}^{27} \text{weights.W}_x}$$

---

### Layer 3: Feedback Learning (ORS + SRS Adaptation Loops)
A post-session feedback loop simulates algorithm self-training. The algorithm uses brief Outcome Rating Scales (ORS) and Session Rating Scales (SRS) to adjust weights dynamically.

#### Math & Constants
*   **Outcome Gain calculation:**
    $$\text{Outcome} = 0.5 \times \left(\frac{\Delta\text{ORS}}{6}\right) + 0.5 \times \left(\frac{\text{SRS}_{\text{mean}}}{40}\right)$$
    *   $\Delta\text{ORS}$ is the change in ORS score relative to reliable change index (`6` points).
    *   $\text{SRS}_{\text{mean}}$ is calculated relative to maximum possible score (`40` points).
*   **Population Mean Expected Performance:** $\mu = 0.75$
*   **Learning Rate (gradient step):** $\eta = 0.05$
*   **Weight Update Formula:**
    For each dimension $x$ where the therapist scored exceptionally well ($\text{dims.W}_x > 80$), adjust weight $W_x$:
    $$\Delta W_x = \eta \times (\text{Outcome} - \mu) \times W_x$$
    $$W_{x, \text{new}} = \text{Max}\left(W_{x, \text{min}}, \text{Min}\left(W_{x, \text{max}}, W_{x, \text{current}} + \Delta W_x\right)\right)$$
*   **Weight Adaptation Boundaries:**
    *   A weight can never drift beyond $\pm 20\%$ of its original default value:
        *   $W_{x, \text{max}} = W_{x, \text{default}} \times 1.20$
        *   $W_{x, \text{min}} = W_{x, \text{default}} \times 0.80$

## ❓ 6. Project Unknowns & Confirmation Checklist

> [!WARNING]
> The following details are either missing from code configuration files or require user verification before deploying to production:

*   **Live Deployment URL:** The Vercel link in `README.md` is currently a placeholder: `[Vercel Link (Insert Link Here)]`. *Action: Update with live link once deployed.*
*   **Waitlist Booking Action Hook:** The waitlist/booking button currently points to dummy routes (`/booked` or `/matches`). In a production service, these would trigger an database integration (e.g. Supabase, PostgreSQL) or a Calendar webhook (e.g. Cal.com/Calendly).
*   **Therapeutic Chat assistant API Key:** The therapeutic chatbot assistant (`components/AIAssistant.tsx`) uses client-side simulated responses. Integrate an LLM (e.g. OpenAI/Gemini) if real-time interactive journaling is desired.
